Although Rihanna couldn’t make it to this year’s Met Gala (due to work-work-work-work-work obligations), she certainly had her own share of fancy dress fittings: She was tied into Adam Selman’s layered princess sundress, and the singer’s dutiful styling team put the finishing touches on a spring-ready frock that she paired with—what else?—a pair of Puma lace-ups.

For those who did hit the red carpet Monday night, though, getting-ready pics were necessary. First-time guest and emerging style star Amandla Stenberg struck a wide pose, showcasing the voluminous hem of her custom Calvin Klein red wide-leg pantsuit with matching crop top and blazer. Edie Campbell quite literally followed suit, putting her best foot forward in her Burberry glam-rock floor-skimming flares and tailored blazer—sans shirt, of course. The evening’s latest, most awaited arrival, Beyoncé smoldered on the Met steps in her pearl-studded Givenchy latex gown, but not before taking her own photo.

While it was a big week in fashion, politics certainly loomed large, too, and Emily Ratajkowski was in the midst of both worlds. At the White House, where she wore a patriotic red dress while lobbying for arts funding in public schools, she appeared to make a very convincing case.
